                <p><br>1. @6PackOfBeers Is the 2010 superhero comedy Kick-Ass still a perfect movie? I do not know</br><br>2. @obliquebleak Ah that's a shame. I felt the same about his Suspiria - every time it threatened to turn into a kick-ass horror movie it then shied away as if horror was a dirty emotion to be feeling.</br><br>3. @supermariomovie @TanukidLeaf @prattprattpratt @KeeganMKey @jackblack @Sethrogen @CharlesMartinet @SebastianComedy @illumination Really hope we can see some kick-ass action from Peach. I’m expecting her to be able to stand up for herself (somewhat) in this movie! https://t.co/NBN2pcc9ei</br><br>4. @TechnicallyRon That gun is kick-ass. Looks straight out of Cyberpunk.</br><br>5. @RawAFMovies I went to this movie with zero expectations. Me and my friend wanted to experiment that if we bought the cheap tickets could we sit in the last row(recliner) and hence chose a random movie. So that even if we were kicked out,we won't feel bad.Turned out to be a kick-ass movie</br><br>6. @Smv_Comics I was thinking of becoming one, but when I read Kick-Ass (Goated comic and movie btw), it made me change my mind 💀💀💀 https://t.co/CbiQazzhvw</br><br>7. tambahin; ted, the dictator, the interview, mr bones, 21 jump street, kick-ass, superhero movie https://t.co/rE0FD8m8fa</br><br>8. Top 3 movies (5): (I dont watch many movies but)
1. No Game No Life the Movie

#KickAss #MovieReviews</br><br>11. If I had to choose between a PS5 or This Print for Christmas...It would be This Print! 

It's only a limited edition print of only the most beautiful &amp; badass human being on the planet playing a Sadistic evil dominatrix in a Kick-Ass Movie....No Big ❤️ 😍 https://t.co/rtWitH6cFi</br><br>12. @JoebiWan94 @Massive_Peace Kick-Ass wasn’t based on a comic, Matthew Vaughn and Mark Millar came up with the idea together. The movie just had trouble getting funded so it came out a lot later.</br><br>13. @ChristinaTasty Not a movie but that Daredevil show. Other than that nothing. Kick-Ass is my all time favorite but I understand it isn't perfect, even if it isn't Marvel</br><br>14. @bellamagick315 Retweeting so others may be as kick-ass thrilled for you as I am.  In our house, that movie is HEAT--but I'd say Goodfellas is foolproof!😊🙌😊</br><br>15. Black Adam trailer, kick-ass. Actual movie... meh</br></p>
